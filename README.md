# Community Maintained

I hope this tool is useful for you! Unfortunately I don't use it personally anymore, and I don't want to spend lots of time working on it. Please let me know if you want to help maintain it and respond to the GitHub issues and pull requests.

However, I'm happy to accept any pull requests to keep the project working if the code is high quality and has 100% test coverage. Thanks a lot for your help!

## Requirements

- Python 3.4+
  - _Python 2.x is not supported._
- pip

### Install Python & pip

#### Windows

- [Download Python 3.7.0](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0.exe)

#### Mac

- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (if not already installed):

```
which brew > /dev/null 2>&1 || /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

- Install Python (includes `pip`):

```
brew install python
```

> Alternatively, you can [download the Python 3.7.0 installer for Mac](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-macosx10.9.pkg).

#### Linux (Ubuntu)

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python
```

## Authentication

If your Apple account has two-factor authentication enabled,
you will be prompted for a code when you run the script.

Two-factor authentication will expire after an interval set by Apple,
at which point you will have to re-authenticate. This interval is currently two months.

Authentication cookies will be stored in a temp directory (`/tmp/pyicloud` on Linux, or `/var/tmp/...` on MacOS.) This directory can be configured with the `--cookie-directory` option.

You can receive an email notification when two-factor authentication expires by passing the
`--smtp-username` and `--smtp-password` options. Emails will be sent to `--smtp-username` by default,
or you can send to a different email address with `--notification-email`.

If you want to send notification emails using your Gmail account, and you have enabled two-factor authentication, you will need to generate an App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

### System Keyring

You can store your password in the system keyring using the `icloud` command-line tool
(installed with the `pyicloud` dependency):

    $ icloud --username jappleseed@apple.com
    ICloud Password for jappleseed@apple.com:
    Save password in keyring? (y/N)

If you have stored a password in the keyring, you will not be required to provide a password
when running the script.

If you would like to delete a password stored in your system keyring,
you can clear a stored password using the `--delete-from-keyring` command-line option:

    $ icloud --username jappleseed@apple.com --delete-from-keyring

## Error on first run

When you run the script for the first time, you might see an error message like this:

```
Bad Request (400)
```

This error often happens because your account hasn't used the iCloud API before, so Apple's servers need to prepare some information about your photos. This process can take around 5-10 minutes, so please wait a few minutes and try again.

If you are still seeing this message after 30 minutes, then please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/icloud_photos_downloader/issues/new) and post the script output.

## Cron Task

Follow these instructions to run `icloudpd` as a scheduled cron task.

```
# Clone the git repo somewhere
git clone https://github.com/ndbroadbent/icloud_photos_downloader.git
cd icloud_photos_downloader

# Copy the example cron script
cp cron_script.sh.example cron_script.sh
```

- Update `cron_script.sh` with your username, password, and other options

- Edit your "crontab" with `crontab -e`, then add the following line:

```
0 */6 * * * /path/to/icloud_photos_downloader/cron_script.sh
```

Now the script will run every 6 hours to download any new photos and videos.

> If you provide SMTP credentials, the script will send an email notification
> whenever two-step authentication expires.

## Docker

This script is available in a Docker image: `docker pull ndbroadbent/icloudpd`

Usage:

```bash
# Downloads all photos to ./Photos

$ docker pull ndbroadbent/icloudpd
$ docker run -it --rm --name icloud -v $(pwd)/Photos:/data ndbroadbent/icloudpd:latest \
    -v $(pwd)/cookies:/cookies \
    -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
    icloudpd --directory /data \
    --cookie-directory /cookies \
    --folder-structure {:%Y/%Y-%m-%d} \
    --username testuser@example.com \
    --password pass1234 \
    --size original \
    --recent 500 \
    --auto-delete
```

On Windows:
- use `%cd%` instead of `$(pwd)`
- or full path, e.g. `-v c:/photos/icloud:/data`

Building image locally:
```bash
$ docker build . -t icloudpd
$ docker run -it --rm icloudpd:latest icloudpd --version
```
